# comctl32-toolbar-padding-height.patch

*Status page. Levels as in winum's AGENTS.md. "Not recorded" means no result was written down, not that the check failed.*

- **DLL:** `comctl32`
- **Origin:** Autodesk-Inventor-for-Linux, commit `8efbd55`, first shipped in `wine-11.19-1`
- **In winum:** `patches/series` from winum-11.20-1

## Problem as the user saw it

Drawing text editor: the symbol palette was taller than on Windows and needed a scroll bar.

## Cause and fix

Button height padding is taken from `TB_SETPADDING` like the width.

## Wine test

None in the patch.
